# MapChart
I needed a tool that would allow me to represent data on a map. The goal was to have one that, even if not easy to use (at the moment), provided a map that could be read immediately and easily understandable by everyone.
The problem was divided into two sub-programs and so pages: one to find the coordinates for each city in the inserted file, aka geocoding, and the other to create the map per se.
